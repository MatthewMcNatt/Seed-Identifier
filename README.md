# Seed-identifier

Seed-identifier is an application developed by group 12 in the spring semester of the CSE3310 Fundamentals of Engineering course, at the University of Texas at Arlington.

This application allows the user to scan, recognize and describe **corn, cucumber and sunflower seeds**. This is done using a trained tensor flow neural network in order to tell apart which seed is which, by parsing an image either with the hardware camera of the device, or by picking an image out of the device's gallery.

Seed-identifier was coded using Java on Android Studio.
